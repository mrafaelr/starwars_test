# starwars test

This is a simple project used to demonstrate data fetching from an API and cloud deployment.

The project is built as a simple react page where the user can calculate facts about the starships in Star Wars. The data is fetched from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/). 

## Usage

When prompted, enter a numerical value corresponding to a distance in mega lights into the input field and click the _submit_ button. The output will show a list of the starships fetched from SWAPI, as well as the number of resupply stops each vessel has to make along the journey.
